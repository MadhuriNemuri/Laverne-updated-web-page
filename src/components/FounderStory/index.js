            <h2>Bespoke Spaces, Crafted From Your Imagination</h2>

            <p>
              At Laverne Studio, we specialise in creating bespoke tree houses,
              playhouses and activity lofts for children and adults, designed for
              backyards, lawns, villas, farmhouses and schools.
            </p>

            <p>
              From a reference image you love to a space designed around your exact
              requirements, we bring your vision to life through custom craftsmanship,
              carefully selected materials and precise detailing.
            </p>

            <p>
              We are particularly known for crafting custom replicas and inspired
              recreations of selected furniture, structures and spaces—reimagined to
              suit your dimensions, environment and functional needs.
            </p>
